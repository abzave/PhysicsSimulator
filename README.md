# Physics Simulator in Python

This physics simulator project simulates the movement of an object in 1 and 2 dimensions following the mathetical ecuations that describe it. This project is developed in Python using Tkinter for GUI.

## Project Overview

The physics simulator creates a virtual 1 dimension or 2 dimension space where objects can be created and interacted with, in order to allow the user to play around with physics concepts.

## Features

- **Multiple Dimensions**: The user can choose to create a virtual environment with 1 dimension or 2 dimensions.
- **Create Multiple Objects**: Allows the user to create as many objects as desired.
- **Object Interaction**: The user is able to interact with every object created independently like dragging an object or throwing it around.
- **Realistic Movement**: Movements follow mathematical ecuations used in real world physics.

## Requirements

- **Run everywhere with Python**: The project can run on any platform as long as it has a Python interpreter installed.
- **Multi-threading**: Avoids blocking the main thread with object are moving freely by using multiple threads.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/abzave/PhysicsSimulator.git
cd PhysicsSimulator
```

### Step 2: Run the program

``` bash
python3 Main.py
```

## Usage

1. Click the button for the amount of dimensions. The options are 1 dimension and 2 dimensions.
2. Click on the add point button
3. Click the newly added point and drag it to the desired position.
